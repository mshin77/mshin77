### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is **Mikyung Shin**. I will be an Assistant Professor in the Department of Special Education at âœ¨ [_Illinois State University_](https://illinoisstate.edu) âœ¨. 

- I am a bilingual (Korean/English) educator and have supported students, families, and communities from diverse backgrounds. 
- âš¡I specialize in mathematics, special education, technology, meta-analysis, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and programming languages. 
-   My research interests include mathematics instruction for students with learning disabilities, instructional technology, and teacher preparation programs in special education. I am also interested in investigating the learnersâ€™ characteristics and effects of mathematics interventions for students with mathematics learning disabilities, using meta-analyses and big-data analyses.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects that include a text mining approach in analyzing text data in the special education fields. I am also investigating the visual and quantitative analysis of studies with single-case experimental designs and continuously developing mathematics apps for students with mathematics learning difficulties and disabilities.
