### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is **Mikyung Shin**. I am an Assistant Professor of Special Education at âœ¨ _West Texas A&M University_ âœ¨. I have a demonstrated history of working in the special education industry. I am skilled in Data Analysis, Microsoft Office, Statistics, and Research and a strong education professional with a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) focused in Special Education from The University of Texas at Austin.

- âš¡ My research interests include mathematics instruction for students with learning disabilities, instructional technology, and teacher preparation programs in special education. I am also interested in investigating the learnersâ€™ characteristics and effects of mathematics interventions for students with mathematics learning disabilities, using meta-analyses and big-data analyses.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects that include a text mining approach in analyzing text data in the special education fields. I am also investigating the visual and quantitative analysis of studies with single-case experimental designs and continuously developing mathematics apps for students with mathematics learning difficulties and disabilities.
